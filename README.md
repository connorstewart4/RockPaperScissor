# RockPaperScissor

Team members elected to create a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors where the user selects from a home menu to play the computer or close application.

Group Members pair programmes all of the code for this project. Debugging was also an extensive equal effort as group members pivoted from an unnecessarily complex buildout to cleaner code that ran the game.

- 6/14/2022: Frame out file structure.
- 6/15/2022: Created Pocos.
- 6/16/2022: Worked on UI and debugged.
- 6/18/2022: Debugged and pivoted upon realizing that an ENUM required parsing strings to int for comparison to user input while simpler code allowed strings to be compared to strings within the switches and sccomplished our goal of a playable game.

# Takeaways
Working with pair programming helped catching errors along the way and bouncing ideas off of one another to figure out the most efficient code we could create. Overall helped a lot with learning to detail things for the user.
